- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Draven2000
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Physics and gaming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, through a free online resource freeCodeCamp.org<br>
     I'm a graduate with a masters in Physics (2024), which has provided me with solid experience in using Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
-  On top of Physics, I have a passion for Biology and Chemistry too, and after graduating I found a drive to further my coding knowledge too.
